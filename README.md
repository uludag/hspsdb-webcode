# HSPs-db

HSPs-db project aims developing tools for indexing NCBI-BLAST sequence similarity
search results, together with data mining interfaces.

Everyday researchers all over the world run millions of BLAST
searches; aim here is to prepare tools to make more sense of these search results.
Latest version of the BLAST software have improved outputs (xml2 project)
which makes our task easier.

We use Elasticsearch for indexing and storing BLAST results.
We have open eye for Solr and Mongodb.
