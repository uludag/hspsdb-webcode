TODO Roadmap mix:
================


- Pivot-table view;
  - Better/more dimensions?
  - Dynamic selection of default rows and columns based on query results
  - Heatmap; higher scores should have stronger colors

- Add more filters; gaps?, identities?, maybe for all numeric attributes?

- Improve hspsdb-indexer script that generates the sample database

- Visual output similar to EBI SSS result pages? sequence/subject match

- New form for importing json/xml output files
  Write test for the import function, import from a json file first

- Repeat/Run BLAST searches on EMBL-EBI/NCBI?

- Should we have separate tabs for aggregation results and query results?

- Heroku test app with Bonsai Elasticsearch service for a larger sample db

- When NCBI results import is successful, take the user directly to view it (Tanvir)

- Taxonomy reports as in NCBI TaxBLAST reports (Tanvir)

- Circos views using https://github.com/nicgirault/circosJS/

- Default results view: use colors to indicate how strong a match
