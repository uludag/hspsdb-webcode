TODO Roadmap mix:
================

- We do queries in result level, i.e. whether a whole BLAST result match the query.
  We should however apply the filters and query terms to the inner elements
 (hits/hsps) and should return matching parts of the results rather than whole.

- Pivot-table view; can we add more dimensions?
  Dynamic selection of default rows and columns
  Heatmap; higher scores should have stronger colors

- When NCBI result import is successful, take the user directly to view it (Tanvir)

- List selected filters together with options to remove them (as in FARNA)
  Add more filters, hit-length, identities, maybe for all numeric attributes

- Should be possible to generate a sample database by a script that should
  run a set of searches on EMBL-EBI and NCBI BLAST servers?

- Visual output similar to EBI SSS result pages? sequence/subject match

- New form for importing json/xml output files

- Link for import scripts (indexer project)

- Repeat/Run BLAST searches on EMBL-EBI/NCBI?

- Should we have separate tabs for aggregation results and query results?

- No need to retrieve sequences/alignments when constructing the Kablammo view?

- Is it possible not to retrieve HSPs list in the first query?

- Taxonomy reports as in NCBI TaxBLAST reports (Tanvir)

- Circos views using https://github.com/nicgirault/circosJS/
