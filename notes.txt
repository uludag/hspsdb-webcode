TODO Roadmap mix:
================

- Pivot-table view; can we add more dimensions?
  Dynamic selection of default rows and columns
  Heatmap; higher scores should have stronger colors

- Add more filters; gaps?, identities?, maybe all numeric attributes?

- Should be possible to generate a sample database by a script that should
  run a set of searches on EMBL-EBI and NCBI BLAST servers?

- Visual output similar to EBI SSS result pages? sequence/subject match

- New form for importing json/xml output files

- Repeat/Run BLAST searches on EMBL-EBI/NCBI?

- Should we have separate tabs for aggregation results and query results?

- No need to retrieve sequences/alignments when constructing the Kablammo view?

- When NCBI results import is successful, take the user directly to view it (Tanvir)

- Taxonomy reports as in NCBI TaxBLAST reports (Tanvir)

- Circos views using https://github.com/nicgirault/circosJS/

- Default results view: use colors to indicate how strong a match
