=====

- Pivot-table view, can we add more dimensions?
  Dynamic selection of default rows and columns

- If the import is successful, take the user directly to view it (Tanvir)

- Pivot table colors, higher scores should have stronger colors

- List selected filters together with options to remove them (as in FARNA)

- Should be possible to generate a sample database by a script that should
  run a set of searches on NCBI and EBI BLAST servers?

- Visual output similar to EBI result pages? sequence/subject match

- New form for importing json/xml output files

- link for import scripts

- Repeat or Run BLAST searches on EBI/NCBI??

- Should we have separate tabs for aggregation results and query results?

- No need to retrieve sequences/alignments when constructing the Kablammo view

- Is it possible not to retrieve HSPs list in the first query

- Taxonomy reports as in NCBI TaxBLAST reports (Tanvir)

- Circos views using 'nicgirault/circosJs'


Notes for developers:
======

When changing active view;
   class 'active' need to be set for the tab div as well as the content div
